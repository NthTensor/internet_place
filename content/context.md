This is an place for me to post my ideas publicly on the internet, which is a thing I have decided to do for some reason. I'm a mathematician and a software developer, I contribute to some [open source projects][1], and I care a lot about speculative fiction. So the things I post are probably going to concern those things.

Yours, <br/> Miles Silberling-Cook
